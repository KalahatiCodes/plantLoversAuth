# PLANT LOVERS QUARRY
A simple plant lover's forum, demonstrating the usage of authorization (login/logout/signup) process for user access.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB, Mongo Client

I build plant lovers united forum using express framework. Using passport connection, I created a local login database located in a mongodb collection created for this specific demo. Using the body-parser to isolate specific data, I was able to parse what information should be stored and communicated between my routes, server, main javascript and ejs.

<!-- ## Optimizations
I further optimized the forum by adding a plant lookup API that displays an image and a description of the plant looked up if it's in the database. If the plant is not identifiable (not in the database) it will return flower not detected and direct the user to the option of adding the flower to a [mongo] database adding a name, photo, and descripition.  -->

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to hard code information using an object in the post section of my routes whilst connecting to my ejs file.
